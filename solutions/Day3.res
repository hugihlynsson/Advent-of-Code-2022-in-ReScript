// Part 1

// Split the input by lines
// Find the amount of the items (line length) and split it in the middle
// Create a set of each side items and return the intersecting items
// Flatten the list to a long list of intersections
// Calculate the priority of each intersection
// Get the solution by reducing the list to its sum
